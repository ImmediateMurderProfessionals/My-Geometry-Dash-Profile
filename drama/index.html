  <h2>About any accusations that I may have done something wrong</h2>
  <p>So I hope to get my first rate very soon, and as I have been accused of a lot of bad shit before, I'm debunking all these allegations here so that I don't get into much drama when I get popular.</p>
  <h3>Doxxing allegations</h3>
<p>These doxxing allegations come from a singular comment on the insane demon CraZy II by DavJT posted in May 2023 and deleted the next day, reading "BCMGF1137 is the coolest player in his hometown, the [REDACTED] hometown of Probably [REDACTED]". When I said that comment, I did not know I was doxxing BCMGF1137 and was just trying to compliment him. I did know of my wrongdoings literally the next day, that's why I deleted that comment the following day. Since then, BCMGF1137 has overplayed the severity of the doxxing, and he still gives me shit about it (he even discredited me in his level <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy4DdXdcteo">Minuit</a> even though I don't deserve it) ten and a half months later, even though I have tried to apologize to him like a million times already. Why the fuck won't he accept my apologies? I'm a better person now than I was then, when I posted that I was an immature seventh grader with the maturity of a twelve-year-old, now I'm a mature eighth grader with the maturity of a fifteen-year-old. Also, even if you know BCMGF1137's hometown, you still don't know which person there is him. This drama was in the past and caused by immaturity, I have already received my punishment five times over (a two-month ban from H: The Series, ten months later and I'm still banned), and I do not think anyone on the Internet should give either me or BCMGF1137 any hate, as I do not encourage hate towards anybody.</p>
  <h3>Child porn and bestiality allegations</h3>
<p>These allegations come from a troll named Xumi Chess, who in August 2023 photoshopped my comments and made a fake YouTube channel pretending to be me to make it seem like I own child porn and fuck my dog [sic] in a YouTube video (the original video is deleted, but a reupload can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGPbr__VJRw">here</a>). None of these claims are true, as I do not own child porn (I'm 13 as of writing this on March 21, 2024) and don't even have a dog, and even if I did have a dog, I wouldn't fuck it because that's just utterly disgusting.</p>
  <h3>Hatred towards religions (notably Christianity and Islam)</h3>
<p>These come from a series of levels titled "Islam Haram" uploaded in Winter 2023 and the levels "fvck the church" in June and its sequel "GOD IS A P9DOPHILE" in December. The Islam Haram series comes from a lot of batshit insane things in Islam, such as:</p>
  <li>Rampant pedophilia. Example: the Prophet Muhammad (piss be upon him) married a six-year-old girl when he was 53, and the two of them <b>had sex</b> just three years later. In what world is it ACCEPTABLE for a 56-year-old man to have sex with a NINE-year-old girl?</li>
  <li>Misogyny. The description for one of the levels in the series (can't remember which one) stated that if a woman said "no" to her husband, he was allowed to rape her.</li>
  <li>Terrorism. Have you not heard of 9/11?</li>
  <li>Barbaric laws. Example: "Atheists and religious skeptics can be executed in at least thirteen nations: Afghanistan, Iran, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Libya, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen." -Wikipedia. There are more, for example Pakistan recently executed a 22-year-old student over motherfucking WhatsApp messages. There are more human rights abuses but I am too lazy to research them all.</li>
<p>I may also add that a lot of the things in Islam Haram also come from immaturity; I was twelve when I made those levels and now I will be fourteen next Friday. I don't want to "END ISLAM" anymore; I'm fine with people being Muslims (I have a Muslim classmate that's perfectly okay, but I am a bit mad that his dad is ten years older than his mom), I just don't like when people hate on other groups (especially LGBTQ+ and non-Muslims) because of their religion. Christianity is similar; there are a lot of bigots in it too. That's not the reason why I uploaded fvck the church. That level was uploaded because of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases>sexual abuse in the Catholic Church</a>, while its sequel GOD IS A P9DOPHILE was uploaded because it is often said that Mary gave birth to Jesus at a young age, ranging between about 13 and 16 depending on who you ask, and as someone between 13 and 16, I would be disgusted if any of my classmates got pregnant for sure. <br><br>The thing about religions is this: I don't hate anyone based on their religion, sexuality, race, grades in school, favorite color, political beliefs, age, shoes, wealth, or anything else; I only hate people based on their actions, and bigotry, pedophilia, and other disgusting shit can be enough to make me hate them. My dad is a conservative Christian and he's a perfectly fine guy.</p>
  <h3>Telling a user named Nicoletti to kill themself</h3>
<p>Shut up. Nicoletti and I are friends now, I was just mad because Nicoletti was being annoying. The only people that should kill themselves are Donald Trump and also those dipshits that dislike bomb my profile posts because I don't deserve to get all my profile posts disliked because I am innocent.</p>
  <h3>Homophobia allegations</h3>
<p>These bullshit allegations stem from a single comment I made on Abyss of Darkness in April 2022 saying "Like if extreme demon, dislike and ignore if you are gay" This comment was made because the top comment on the level said <b>exactly the same thing</b> and I like being a copycat. I was not trying to be homophobic (I knew little about the LGBTQ+ community at the time) and in fact now make supporting the LGBTQ+ community and other minorities a core part of my personality. In fact, I am wondering if I might be bisexual, as my sexual preferences are as follows: I would have sex with or date anyone of any sex or gender who can legally consent, but I'd likely only pursue a long-term relationship with a biological woman because I want to have kids. (Note that I am under the age of consent so please don't ship me with anyone)</p>
  <h3>Racism allegations</h3>
<p>These also bullshit allegations stem from a single level, titled "fizzarolli body pill" (fuck the character limit). That level is just a short shitpost where Caillou gets grounded by his dad, Goanimate style. In it, his dad calls him the hard R. This is not me being racist (I hate racists with a burning passion), the level was just a silly joke, also Boris (Caillou's dad) is the antagonist. It makes much more sense to have a racist antagonist rather than a racist protagonist.</p>
  <h3>Other miscellaneous hatred</h3>
<p>I have also been accused of hating a few other groups and people. WIP</p>
