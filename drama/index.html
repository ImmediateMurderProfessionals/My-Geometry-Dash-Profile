  <h2>About any accusations that I may have done something wrong</h2>
  <p>So I hope to get my first rate very soon, and as I have been accused of a lot of bad shit before, I'm debunking all these allegations here so that I don't get into much drama when I get popular.</p>
  <h3>Doxxing allegations</h3>
<p>These doxxing allegations come from a singular comment on the insane demon CraZy II by DavJT posted in May 2023 and deleted the next day, reading "BCMGF1137 is the coolest player in his hometown, the [REDACTED] hometown of Probably [REDACTED]". When I said that comment, I did not know I was doxxing BCMGF1137 and was just trying to compliment him. I did know of my wrongdoings literally the next day, that's why I deleted that comment the following day. Since then, BCMGF1137 has overplayed the severity of the doxxing, and he still gives me shit about it (he even discredited me in his level <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy4DdXdcteo">Minuit</a> even though I don't deserve it) ten and a half months later, even though I have tried to apologize to him like a million times already. Why the fuck won't he accept my apologies? I'm a better person now than I was then, when I posted that I was an immature seventh grader with the maturity of a twelve-year-old, now I'm a mature eighth grader with the maturity of a fifteen-year-old. This drama was in the past and caused by immaturity, I do not think anyone on the Internet should give either me or BCMGF1137 any hate, as I do not encourage hate towards anybody.</p>
  <h3>Child porn and bestiality allegations</h3>
<p>These allegations come from a troll named Xumi Chess, who in August 2023 photoshopped my comments and made a fake YouTube channel pretending to be me to make it seem like I own child porn and fuck my dog [sic] in a YouTube video (the original video is deleted, but a reupload can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGPbr__VJRw">here</a>). None of these claims are true, as I do not own child porn (I'm 13 as of writing this on March 21, 2024) and don't even have a dog, and even if I did have a dog, I wouldn't fuck it because that's just utterly disgusting.</p>
  <h3>Hatred towards religions (notably Christianity and Islam)</h3>
<p>I'll finish this later I have classwork.</p>
