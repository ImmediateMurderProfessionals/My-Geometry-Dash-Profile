  <h2>My levels!</h2>
<p><i>Warning: this page is unfinished. More coming soon!</i></p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: a lot of my levels in GD are filled with sex jokes and other inappropriate shit, and thus a lot of things I upload are intended for ages 13+. These levels are notable exceptions, as rated levels are supposed to be for all ages, and I intend on getting these levels rated.</p>
<p>I am a very good creator (in my opinion) in Geometry Dash! Here are a few levels I have made, am making, or will make with the intent of getting rated. (data as of 4/12/2024). If progress occurs at an inconsistent pace, it is due to my shitty work ethic. Don't judge me, I just like shitposting.</p>
